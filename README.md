# nuimchem

nuimchem is an application I designed and developed for the National University of Ireland - Maynooth. The application was designed in mind to cater to the Chemistry staff and student' needs. Users' could search for chemicals and novel compounds, list new chemicals, novel compounds and mark items as waste. Each user had complete control over their own chemicals and novel compounds, while other users', as part of the brief, were allowed to alter details regarding each chemical (where the chemical was stored and how much was left). The staff, as well as students, needed a way of quickly generating reports on particular chemicals and waste products, such as carcinogens and mutagens, as such were able to generate these reports.

The application was tested and debugged using Google's App Engine for Python. The front end was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and embedded Python (Jinja2), while the backend was developed using Python. A GQL database was modelled and implemented as shown in the main.py file.

The application consists of two web pages; a login screen which allowed users' to login and register, and a navigation screen which allowed users' to "navigate" through the site by filling a defined portion of the screen with the appropriate template.

The Google App Engine and Python (at least 2.7) are required to run this web application.

Any tips and suggestions are much appreciated. Thank you.
